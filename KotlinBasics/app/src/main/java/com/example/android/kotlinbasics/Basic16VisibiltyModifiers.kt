// 4 types of visibility modifiers-
// public (default)
// private (allows the element to be accessible only within the block in which properties, fields, etc are declared)
// protected (A protected modifier with a class or an interface allows visibility to its class or subclass only)
// internal (makes the field visible only inside the module in which it is implemented)
